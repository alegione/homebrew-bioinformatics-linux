# homebrew-bioinformatics-linux

_The too hard basket for Linux bioinformatics brew formulae_!

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is the software packaging system for Mac OS X
that Apple should have written. 
[Linuxbrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew) is a fork of Homebrew for
Linux.  One of the best features of Brew is that a user without root
privileges can install packages in their own home directory.

Packages are described by _formulae_ which are simple to write, and based on
Ruby.  Formulae are kept in _taps_.  There are lots of good taps.  The one I
use a lot is
[homebrew-science](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science).  However
to get into an offical tap like that one, a tool needs to be capable of
being compiled and/or run on Mac OS X.  I use Linuxbrew for my servers, and
some of our tools are too hard to compile for OS X or simply only exist as
Linux binaries.  So that's why I started this project.

If you have brew installed, you can enable this repository like this:

    brew tap tseemann/homebrew-bioinformatics-linux
    
You will also need the main `homebrew-science` tap:

    brew tap homebrew/science
    
Then you can install any formulae I have written, for example:

    brew install blast-legacy
    brew install figtree

If you are on OS X, some of these formulae _may_ work, but some won't. 

I'm happy to accept pull requests for new packages, but if it would not take
too much effort to work on OS X too, then I will suggest you contribute it
to [homebrew-science](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science) instead. 
This repository is really just a "too hard basket" for Linux bioinformatics
tools.  But, if possible, I would like formulae here to ultimately be
migrated to [homebrew-science](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science).
